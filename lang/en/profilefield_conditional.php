<p>I\'m truly happy to know that this plugin has been useful for you.
 I\'ve kept it free so anyone can benefit from it. To sustain this, I\'ve always offered a voluntary donation option for those who find it valuable.
 However, after {$a->years} years, the total support received has been minimal (just {$a->donations} donations as of the release of this version). While I\'m glad it\'s useful, this
 makes it hard to justify prioritising updates without community backing.
</p>
<p>You can change that:
<ul>
    <li>A small donation helps me dedicate more time to this project.</li>
    <li>Ensures faster updates and new features.</li>
    <li>Keeps it free for everyone.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><i>(This message is visible only to youâ€”not end users.)</i></p>
<p>If this plugin saves you time, consider supporting its future.</p>
<p><a href="{$a->donationlink}" target="_blank">Click here to make a donation!</a></p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this journey.</p>';
